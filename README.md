# Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks for Phase Recognition
## Project Description 

## Background 

## Results 

## Code and Installation
### qml 
Before running any of the scripts, users must first install the qml module itself. This can be done as follows: 
* Clone this repo and change directory in the terminal to the `/qml_src` directory.
* Run the following command: `pip install -e ./` 
* Check that it is installed by running `pip list` and looking for the module named `qml`

## Acknowledgements
We would like to give a huge thank you to Iris Cong from Harvard for all of her insightful discussions and her guidance throughout the project! We would like to thank Dr.Ronagh Pooya for giving us the opportunity to pursue this ambitious (and slightly un-orthodox) direction for as our final course project. We would also like to thank him for giving us access to cloud compute resources which allowed us to easily train and validate all of the models we developed. 

## Meet the Team
**Jay Soni** *(Project Lead + QML Lead)*: A Mathematical Physics major with a passion for quantum computing. Enjoys coding almost as much as he enjoys drinking Ice Capps! 

**Ivan Sharankov** *(Lead Software Dev)*: Astrophysics major who's looking to continue his masters in computational physics. I love programming and will jump on any hackathon or project I can find. Interested in handling big data, machine learning applications in physics, cryptography/system security, and network engineering.
